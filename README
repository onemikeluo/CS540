The goal of this project is to discover if the proximity between a parcel and the nearest warehouse/distribution center actually affect the selling price of the parcel.

With the general view of the distribution map reflecting the locations of warehouse/distribution center (volusia.png), 
we see a majority of them are located near the urban area, with several located near the interstate highways.

My prediction specifically focused on the greater Deland area, 
as I could identify an obvious price linear relationship between the a parcel and the nearest warehouse/distribution center
while i could not identify the linear trend for the beach side cities.
