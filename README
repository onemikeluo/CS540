The goal of this project is to discover if the proximity between a parcel and the nearest warehouse/distribution center actually affect the selling price of the parcel.

With the general view of the distribution map reflecting the locations of warehouse/distribution center (volusia.png), 
we see a majority of them are located near the urban area, with several located near the interstate highways.

My prediction specifically focused on the greater Deland area, 
as I could identify a price linear relationship between the parcel and the nearest warehouse/distribution center
while I could not identify the linear trend for the beach side cities.

1st, refer to "new_column_sql" to add a new column which will be useful in the 2nd step to calculate the distance between parcel and nearest warehouse location;
2nd, at this point, the new column is set up, refer to "new_column_loop.ipynb" 
     to make sure every applicable parcel has its distance calculated to the nearest warehouse/distribution center;
3rd, now use linear regression to predict if the house price is actually affected by the gcdistance from the nearest warehouse/distribution center
     refer to "regression.ipynb" for regression.
     
Refer to "Inidvidual Project.pdf" for details.
